Greetings! This program implements the function of an automatic parser of information from the Internet. Namely, the parsing of the FSTEC threat databank, which is located on the site in excel table format. Convenient display of information was implemented in two versions: full and reduced. If the user already has this databank, then it can be updated in this program.

At startup, a window is displayed with a choice: open the file or download, if it is not there. If you chose to download, then you need to specify where to save the file. If you chose to open the file, the file selection window opens, and then it is displayed. Now, when you click the update file button, the databank will be downloaded from the site and replace the existing file, and a window with changes in the file will be displayed on the screen.
